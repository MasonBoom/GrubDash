# GrubDash
GrubDash is a mock food delivery service I created for Thinkful's software engineering course.

The requirement for this app was for me to create the backend of the website. I was responsible for building out the routes in the controller and router files in the src folder. I created the functions, middleware, validation, and routes. This code is just the backend for the site.

This code helped me get much more comfortable with building out routes in Node Express.
